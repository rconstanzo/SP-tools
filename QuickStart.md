# Instructions for setting up SP-Tools

## How to start:

1) install the FluCoMa package via the Package Manager in Max or via https://www.flucoma.org/download/
2) download and move the full SP-Tools folder in your Packages folder (~/Documents/Max 8/Packages/), rename the folder to "SP-Tools", and restart Max.
3) ***IMPORTANT*** If you are using the Max for Live devices, make sure you download and install Max version 8.3+ and point Live to it in the preferences (*File Folder -> Max Application -> Browse*)

You can then open the SP-Tools Overview patch via the Package Manager info window, or from the extras menu bar.
