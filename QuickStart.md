# Instructions for setting up SP-Tools

## How to start:

1) install the FluCoMa package via the Package Manager in Max or via https://www.flucoma.org/download/
2) move the full SP-Tools folder in your Packages folder (~/Documents/Max 8/Packages/), rename the folder to "SP-Tools", and restart Max.

You can then open the SP-Tools Overview patch via the Package Manager info window, or from the extras menu bar.
