# SP-Tools - Machine Learning tools for drums and percussion (a few Pure Data abstractions)
I've built a few Pure Data abstractions for my own use and have decided to include them here.
They are all vanilla pd friendly and should work with nothing else installed (except for the FluCoMa externals).

## Requirements
FluCoMa v1.0.6 or higher - [Download Link](https://github.com/flucoma/flucoma-pd/releases/latest)  

## Bela Requirements (still massive work in progress)
